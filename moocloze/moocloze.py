"""Tools to generate moodle questions in XML/Cloze format.

The following workflow is proposed to populate a category of questions in a Moodle question bank:

1. Create a list of (related) Question instances.
2. Define a Quiz containing that list of questions.
3. Use that quiz's to_xml_file method to create a .xml file with the Moodle XML/Cloze format.
4. Create a category in your course question bank.
5. Import the XML file to your question bank (making sure the appropriate category is selected).

See https://docs.moodle.org/402/en/Embedded_Answers_(Cloze)_question_type for more information
on the Cloze question format.
